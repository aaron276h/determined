**New Features**

- Support for `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.

  - Determined can now be deployed on Kubernetes. Determined workloads run as a
    collection of pods, which allows standard Kubernetes tools for logging,
    metrics, and tracing to be used. Determined is compatible with Kubernetes >=
    1.15, including managed Kubernetes services such as Google Kubernetes Engine
    (GKE) and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

  - When using Determined with Kubernetes, we currently do not support
    fair-share scheduling, priority scheduling, per-experiment weights, or
    gang-scheduling for distributed training experiments; workloads will be
    scheduled according the behavior of the default Kubernetes scheduler.

  - Users can configure the behavior of the pods that are launched for
    Determined workloads by specifying a :ref:`custom pod spec
    <custom-pod-specs>`. A default pod spec can be configured when installing
    Kubernetes, but a custom pod spec can also be specified on a per-task basis
    (e.g., via the :ref:`environment.pod_spec <exp-environment-pod-spec>` field
    in the experiment configuration file).

  - For more information on using Determined with Kubernetes, see the
    :ref:`documentation <determined-on-kubernetes>`.
