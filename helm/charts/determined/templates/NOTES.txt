Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. Your release is named: {{ .Release.Name }}.
It may take several minutes for your deployment to start up.

{{- if .Values.useNodePortForMaster }}

You have configured Determined to deploy the master with a NodePort service. To make the
Determined master accessible from outside the cluster you will likely need to configure
an Ingress for: determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }}.

To have Determined configure an externally accessible load balancer for the
maser, please set "Values.useNodePortForMaster" to false.
{{ else }}

Once it is up you can get the IP address of your deployment by running:

kubectl get service determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

{{ end -}}

{{ $httpOrHttps := "http" }}
{{- if .Values.tlsSecret -}}
  {{ $httpOrHttps = "https" }}
  {{ $secret := (lookup "v1" "Secret" .Release.Namespace (.Values.tlsSecret | toString) ) }}
  {{- if eq (len $secret) 0 }}
ERROR: Secret {{ .Values.tlsSecret }} does not exist in namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}. Please update ".Values.tlsSecret".
  {{ end }}
{{ end -}}

{{- if (and (not .Values.detVersion) (contains "dev" .Chart.AppVersion)) }}
ERROR: Installing a non-released version of Determined: {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}.
Determined does not publish docker images for non-release version, attempts to
install a non-release version will lead to a `ImagePullBackOff` error.
Please update `appVersion` in Chart.yaml to an official release version in the
format X.Y.Z (e.g., 0.13.4).

{{ end -}}
Once you have the IP address, configure master address locally by running: `export DET_MASTER=<ip address>:{{ .Values.masterPort }}`.
To submit experiments please install the Determined CLI locally: `pip install determined-cli`.
To access the WebUI go to: {{ $httpOrHttps }}://<ip address>:{{ .Values.masterPort }}.
