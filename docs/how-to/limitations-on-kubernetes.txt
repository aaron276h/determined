Limitations of Determined on Kubernetes
=======================================

Deploying :ref:`Determined on Kubernetes <install-on-kubernetes>` is currently in beta and is under active
development. This document outlines the current limitations of Determined on Kubernetes.


Scheduling
----------

Determined on Kubernetes does not currently support the scheduling policies that are available when
deploying Determined on VMs. These policies include: priority scheduling, fair sharing resources
across experiments and gang-scheduling for distributed training. Determined relies on Kubernetes
to handle scheduling which does not natively support these scheduling policies.

Distributed training experiments that require more than one pod must have all pods scheduled and
running in order to make progress. Due to a lack of gang-scheduling in Kubernetes, when running
distributed training experiments it is possible to deadlock the Kubernetes cluster such that it will
fail to make any progress. For example, if you have a cluster with three 4-GPU nodes, scheduling an experiment
that requires four such nodes will deadlock the cluster. Three pods will start up on the available nodes
and wait for the fourth pod launch, which will never happen due to resource limitations.

To avoid deadlocking your cluster it is recommended to enable cluster autoscaling if possible.
If a possible deadlock is detected, a warning will be displayed in the trial logs.
Upon encountering a deadlock, users should pause, cancel, or kill the deadlocked
experiment(s).


Dynamic Agents
--------------

Determined on :ref:`AWS <install-aws>` and :ref:`GCP <install-gcp>` autoscales compute resources.
Determined on Kubernetes does not yet offer this functionality. Users are encouraged to use
the `Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler <https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler>`_
which is supported on `GKE <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler>`_
and `EKS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html>`_.


Sidecars and InitContainers
---------------------------

Determined on Kubernetes supports user provided pod template specs, however specifying
`init containers <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/>`_
and `sidecar containers <https://www.magalix.com/blog/the-sidecar-pattern>`_.
